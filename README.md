# BodyBalance_ReactJS_Project

![logo-plus-text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc52afcc-2961-48e7-8b8f-3ce396499f8d)

This is my first personal project for the final exam of React JS course at SoftUni with React + Vite, where I practice the usage of components, custom hooks, context APIs.

It is a website for a fitness hall with its schedule, workouts, trainers and contact information.

Users can register, log in and comment the workouts. Only admins can edit/delete workouts.

For the back-end I use the practice server from the university (https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server).

I started the project using HTML Template with Bootstrap (https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page283/purple-buzz).
