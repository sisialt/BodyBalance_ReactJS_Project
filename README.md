This is my first personal project for the final exam of React JS course at SoftUni with React + Vite, where I practice the usage of components, custom hooks, context APIs.

It is a website for a fitness hall with its schedule, workouts, trainers and contact information.

Users can register, log in and comment the workouts. Only admins can edit/delete workouts.

For the back-end I use the practice server from the university (https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server).
